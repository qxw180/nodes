shim&polyfill
> Shim. A shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment, using only the means of that environment.
> Shim是一个类库，将一个新的API添加到旧的环境中，只在这个环境中使用；


> A polyfill is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively. Flattening the API landscape if you will.
> polyfill是一小段代码或插件，开发者希望浏览器自带的功能；
